Online board with a livefeed design, built with Node.Js and Vue.Js for BAU Agile Development Course

## Installing

Install the node modules

Now you can go to localhost:300 to view!

Currently there is not much in the project. There isn't really a ui since the ui was built in a different project.
Soon it will all come together!
